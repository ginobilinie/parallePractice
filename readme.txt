This is the code for final projects of parallel computing. I implemented 4 versions of parallel quicksort. 
As partition of quicksort is not easy to parallize, so I implement a binary sort tree to simulate quicksort because binary sort tree is easy to be parallized.

As for parallel sort algorithms, quicksort is not a good one (Why I implement it is that it is required in the final project), 
radix sort and sample sort are much much better for parallel sort algorithms.

To run the program,

1. bash experiment.sh

2. bash experiment_3.sh
